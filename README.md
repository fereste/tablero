# Tablero

The first idea for this project was to use a car instrument cluster to display speed and RPM of games. To do that, code to control an instrument cluster through the CAN bus was necessary.

Here you will find documentation and code to control a Ford Fiesta MK7.5 instrument cluster. An Arduino Uno is used along with a CAN bus module (MCP 2515).

On the wiki pages, you can find CAN bus IDs and payload documentation.
